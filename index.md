  Processing data on a large scale either in streaming or batch can be done with platforms such as [Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org/){:target="_blank"} or [Apache Storm](https://storm.apache.org/){:target="_blank"}.

  In fact, we have built some of our [open source](https://github.com/digitalpebble){:target='_blank'} solutions on these platforms and have a large experience of using them for our clients.
